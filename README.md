 Created Machine learning project, which focuses on predicting credit card defaults using advanced classification models. The code is divided in below parts:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns and insights from multivariate attributes.
Model Implementation: Building and evaluating machine learning models like Na√Øve Bayes and Random Forest.

This project is an excellent opportunity to apply data analytics skills and tackle real-world financial challenges. Feel free to explore the repository and reach out with feedback or questions!
